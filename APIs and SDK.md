# READ-1-BTEC : APIs and SDK



## Application Programming Interface (API)

APIs, or application programming interfaces, make software development and innovation easier by allowing apps to quickly and securely share data and functionality.


## types of APIs 


1) Public APIs:
APIs that are open to the public. Any outside developer or company can utilize a public API since it is open and available. A company that develops and offers a public API will have a business plan that includes sharing its apps and data with other companies.

Authentication and authorization are usually moderate in public APIs. An organization may also try to monetize the API by charging a per-call fee to use the public API.


2) Partner APIs:
Partner APIs are marketed freely but only shared with business partners that have signed a contract with the publisher. Software integration between two companies is a frequent use case for partner APIs. A firm that gives its partners access to data or capabilities might generate additional income streams. At the same time, it can keep track of how the exposed digital assets are being utilized, ensuring that third-party solutions that use their APIs deliver a good user experience, and guarantee that corporate identity is maintained in their apps.

3)Internal APIs:
An internal (or private) API is designed to link systems and data within the company. An internal API, for example, may link an organization's payroll and HR systems.

Because internal APIs are designed for internal usage, and such security standards are believed to be in place through other policies, they often have poor security and authentication â€” or none at all. This is changing, however, as organizations' API strategies are more influenced by increased threat awareness and regulatory compliance requirements.


4)Composite APIs:
Developers may use composite APIs to access several endpoints in a single call. These might be several services or data sources, or they could be separate endpoints of a single API. Composite APIs are particularly helpful in microservice designs, where a user may require data from many services in order to complete a single operation. Because a single call might return all of the data a user need, composite APIs can minimize server load and enhance application speed.




## The following are some of the benefits of using APIs for developers:

Automation: APIs allow computers to handle tasks rather than individuals. Agencies can use APIs to improve workflows to make them more efficient and productive.

Application: Because APIs may access app components, service and information delivery can be more flexible.

More flexibility: an API may be used to construct an application layer that can be used to disseminate information and services to new audiences and can be customized to provide unique user experiences.

New data is now available: an API allows all government-generated data to be made available to all citizens, not just a chosen few.

Efficiency: When an API is accessed, the material created may be instantly published and made available across all channels. It makes it easier to share and distribute.

Integration: APIs make it easier to embed information from any website or application. This ensures that information is delivered in a more fluid manner and that the user experience is more integrated.

Personalization: APIs allow any user or business to personalize the material and services they consume most frequently.

Adaptation: As demands change over time, APIs can assist in anticipating such changes. Data migration is better facilitated and information is examined more thoroughly when using this technology.





## comparing between APIs and SDK



API and SDK are two concepts in software development that are sometimes misunderstood. API stands for "Application Programming Interface," and it relates to programming instructions and standards for interacting with a website or database. For example, a software firm may frequently make its API available to other software developers, either publicly or privately, so that they can create products that use the service. An SDK, or Software Development Kit, can be used to bundle an API.
An SDK is a set of software development tools that allows you to create apps for a certain platform. One or more APIs, as well as development tools and documentation, can be found in SDKs. Consider the Java SDK, which includes an API as well as compilers, runtimes, and other tools.

An API is a collection of libraries that make up the core language and can be used right away, whereas an SDK is a development kit that makes it easier to use an API. Both are, in theory, ways for your application to communicate with and control resources offered by another piece of software.

So, an API is nothing more than an interface to a service, but an SDK is a collection of tools or components for a specific purpose. In reality, an SDK provides you with an API to interact with, but you may utilize an API without the underlying components if the API is supplied through a web service, for example.
